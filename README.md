####Run [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

In this project, JSON Server was used to simulate a REST API in a simple and fast way.

So before starting the server it is necessary to start our faki api using the `ng run backend` command

####Starting Angular Server
Run `ng serve -open` or `ng s -o` to start the project on the local development server. The browser will automatically open the link `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
